# Milka-Chocolate-Detection

This is a Python program I made *for fun* that uses OpenCV library to detect Milka chocolates in webcam rcordings. It is based on the Haar Cascade classifier, which is a machine learning technique that uses a cascade of simple features to identify objects in video recordings. The program uses the pre-trained models provided by OpenCV for face detection.

# Installation
To run this program, you need to have Python 3 and OpenCV installed on your system. You can install OpenCV using pip:
```
pip install opencv-python
```

You also need to copy and paste the milka.xml file which is inside the repository in your preferred code editor.

# Usage
To use this program, you need to copy the contents of the python file and run it in your code editor.

When you run the program, your default webcam will be displayed with bounding boxes around the detected Milka chocolates. You can press the 'q' key to exit the program.

# Limitations
This program is not perfect and may have some limitations, such as:

It may not detect all chocolates in the recording, especially if they are partially occluded, too small, or too far away.

It may detect some false positives, such as other objects that look like faces, or shadows or reflections.
